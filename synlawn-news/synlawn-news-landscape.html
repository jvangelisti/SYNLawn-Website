<h1 class="content-title">Synthetic Lawn Law Passed!</h1>
<section class="news-wrapper4">

	<p class="content-text2">Its official, California’s AB-349 authored by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) was signed yesterday by Governor Jerry Brown.  What does this mean for all you California homeowner’s governed by a homeowners association (HOA)?  You are now free to install artificial turf in your yard without fear of reproach or fines!  Synthetic turf is now included among a wide variety of drought tolerant landscaping as it can directly reduce outdoor water use to meet the Governor’s mandated 25% water use reduction across the entire State of California.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Assemblywoman Gonzalez is quoted saying “Across the state, Californians are making great strides to reduce their water use and hit aggressive benchmarks for conservation, and this new common sense law will give homeowners one more way to save as this drought continues.  The grass may be fake, but the amount of water a homeowner can save by installing it is very real.”</p>

	<h2 class="news-subtitle">Green is the New Green</h2>

	<p class="content-text2">California Homeowners are eager to have green in their yard again.  We have received numerous calls this year from clients asking us to send samples and brochures so that they could present their findings to their HOA only to be turned away.  This scenario is now a thing of the past.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">You no longer have to accept the infamous saying “brown is the new green” out here in California.  Tired of looking at that brown dead lawn for the past few years?  Satisfy yourself, your pets, your neighbors and our state by installing a lush, estate quality green lawn or a gorgeous and fun putting green that will stand the test of time while you continue to save on your water bill.</p>

<h1 class="content-title">Benefits of SYNLawn</h1>
<section class="news-wrapper4">

	<p class="content-text2">Synthetic grass and artificial turf have wonderful benefits they bring to every installation. You certainly won't have to mow it, again! Think of the impact you will have on reducing your own carbon footprint and use of harmful chemicals!</p>

	<p class="content-text2">SYNLawn is extremely low maintenance, and, when taken care of, can last an extremely long time.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Originally, sports field projects drove the development of most turf products and the benefits would trickle down to the residential and <a href="http://www.synlawnbayarea.com">commercial landscape</a> user, but that has changed. Today's synthetic grass and <a href="http://www.synlawnbayarea.com/photo-galleries/landscape-installations.html">artificial turf</a> yarns deliver outstanding durability, safety, and value, so many homeowners are opting to have SYNLawn installed in their yards.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Not only are homeowners falling in love with the look and feel of <a href="http://www.synlawn.com/lawns.html">SYNLawn</a>, they are reaping the benefits of zero watering cost, durability, and never having mow or weed their lawn!</p>

	<img src="../images/news/150504/SynlawnPlayground.jpg" alt="SYNLawn Playground Photo">

	<p class="content-text2">Another great benefit of installing SYNLawn is that many of the turfs that you can choose from come with the exclusive <a href="http://www.synlawnbayarea.com/pdf/brochures/HeatBlock-Brochure.pdf">HeatBlock technology</a>, which creates a lower rising temperature by reflecting sunlight, and creating a cooler feel.</p>

	<h2 class="news-subtitle">Major Benefits</h2>

	<p class="content-text2">&diams; Zero watering cost</p>
	<p class="content-text2">&diams; No more mowing the lawn</p>
	<p class="content-text2">&diams; Zero weeding</p>
	<p class="content-text2">&diams; HeatBlock Technology means a cooler, more comfortable lawn</p>
	<p class="content-text2">&diams; Padded systems mean a cushion for falls and roughhousing</p>

<h1 class="content-title">Summer Proof Your Pool Area with SYNLawn</h1>
<section class="news-wrapper4">

	<p class="content-text2">With summer right around the corner in Sunny California, it’s going to be a beautiful pool season! While the idea of Summer on its way puts everyone in a good mood, the fact that a lot of those lawns surrounding our customers pools are in dire need of water, or already browned and dead.</p>

	<img src="../images/news/150408/SYNLawnPoolArea1.jpg" alt="SYNLawn Poolside Photo 2">

	<h2 class="news-subtitle">The Science Behind SYNLawn</h2>

	<p class="content-text2">SYNLawn knew there was a need for a product that was built specifically for pool and play areas, so they created the <a href="http://www.synlawnbayarea.com/pdf/brochures/EnviroLoc-Brochure.pdf">EnviroLoc Backing System</a>. This amazing step in the installation of your new <a href="https://www.synlawnbayarea.com">SYNLawn</a> will ensure that your SYNLawn stays beautiful for years to come! SYNLawn's exclusive EnviroLoc Backing technology 'Locks In' turf fibers for lasting beauty and a long life span. Engineered using BioCel technology, this system replaces a large portion of petroleum based polymers with biobased polymers created with soybean plants (a renewable resource). SYNLawn then adds Celceram™ (a recycled product of coal combustion) for superior strength and dimensional stability.</p>

	<a href="http://www.synlawn.com/about-synlawn/enviroloc-backing-system/"><img src="../images/news/150408/enviroloc-450x450.png" alt="SYNLawn EnviroLoc"></a>

	<h2 class="news-subtitle">Safer Pool and Play Areas</h2>

	<p class="content-text2">We've been finishing project after project to surround our customer's pools with <a href="http://www.synlawn.com">SYNLawn</a>! The look of SYNLawn surrounding your pool, gives your backyard the lush look and feel of your very own private oasis! PLUS: No more slipping and sliding on hard concrete or gravel. Children and pets can play in a softer, safer area around the pool.</p>

	<img src="../images/news/150408/SYNLawnPoolArea2.jpg" alt="SYNLawn Pool Area Photo">

	<p class="content-text2">The <a href="http://www.synlawn.com/about-synlawn/enviroloc-backing-system/">EnviroLoc</a> bi-component primary backing includes two layers of woven backing stitched together while adding a layer of polypropylene fiber in-between. This means you get superior strength and durability.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Together these biobased technologies provide a sturdy anchor for fibers for less “shedding” as well as provide an <a href="http://www.synlawn.com/about-synlawn/enviroloc-backing-system/">environmentally responsible</a> approach to artificial grass that conserves Earth’s natural resources and will look great for years to come!</p>

<h1 class="content-title">Beat the Drought with SYNLawn</h1>
<section class="news-wrapper4">

	<p class="content-text2">Hiking water prices, brown lawns, short showers and dirty cars. California residents are feeling the effects of this exceptional drought in full force. We are now entering our fourth year of drought.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">To add to our woes, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, the East Bay Municipal Utility District and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission are all considering hiking water rates up to 30 percent higher this year. These water agencies serve about 80% of the Bay Area’s population. Their reason for hiking the rates: they are selling a lot less water as customer’s conserve as a result of the drought. Of course they are reluctant to make such a decision as it directly impacts homeowner’s wallets in a major way. Their job however, is to ensure there is enough clean, safe water to sustain the economy of the Bay Area. Another reason for the potential hike: they are spending more money on drought-related expenses such as buying extra water from outside the Bay Area to help meet demand.</p>

	<img src="../images/news/150309/California-Drought-Map.png" alt="California Drought Map March 2013">

	<p class="content-text2">California Governor, Jerry Brown has called on Californians to voluntarily reduce their water usage by 20%. To help ease some of the tension of finding alternative solutions to keeping a beautiful yard, Governor Jerry Brown’s recent state of emergency declaration along with the overall public awareness of the California drought have resulted in some rebate opportunities for California homeowners and businesses.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Be sure to check with your city or local ordinance for rebate programs that may be happening to help you reduce your water consumption.</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Water rebates will potentially cover up to $2.50 per square foot for water wise landscaping. Synthetic turf is not only a great alternative to beating the drought, it is also an ideal long term investment in beautifying your yard. Along with reducing your water bill by 60% per year, you can also save on gardener fees and gas to fuel your lawn equipment. On top of it, you no longer have to worry about looking at a brown lawn!</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Make the switch to synthetic turf and go with a company you trust. We have been manufacturing and installing turf for over 40 years. Our grass is eco-friendly, 100% recyclable, is backed by a 15 year warranty and looks great all year long!</p>

	<p class="content-text2">Your pets will thank you, your children will thank you, and you will thank yourself when you see your green lawn and your water bill significantly reduced for the years to come. On top of that, the State of California thanks you for conserving water while keeping a beautiful yard.</p>
